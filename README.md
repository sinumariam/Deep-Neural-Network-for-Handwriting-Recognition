# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Handwriting-Recognition
I am delighted to share my work ' Developing Neural Network that can read Handwriting' which I completed as a part of my Data Science Internship Programme with LetsGrowMore.
Artificial Neural Networks can be effectively used for Recognizing Images which find its way to many applications in Computer Vision. 
Here I adopted Deep Neural network which enables systems to read Handwritten Digits from experience without being specific programmed on the widely used MNIST Dataset which has 60,000 train images and 10,000 test Images.
